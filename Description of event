The event took place in IIT Guwahati and it was a wonderful experience. The event was made to test Image processing skills. The arena was
enclosed in four walls and each of the wall had a shape. We were asked to recognize the shape on the top of the dice and then match it
with each of the shape given in the wall. If the shape matches then the bot will move in the direction of the shape and rotate and come
back to the midlle, else it will rotate on it's point to match the other shape on the wall with the shape found on the dice. All this is
done with the help of Image processing techniques.

The image of arena and the official problem statement of Phototron is attached.
